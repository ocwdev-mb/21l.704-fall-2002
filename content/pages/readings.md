Yes, it's a healthy list. But it's a big chore we've undertaken. I will be asking you to offer regular brief "reflections" on specific poems/poets, to write two short (5 page) and one longer (10-12 page) essay, and to offer a final in-class presentation. Come with questions, energy, a willingness to talk. This could be grand fun -- but much of that will depend on you.
